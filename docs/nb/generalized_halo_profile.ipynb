    "## Motivation\n",
    "The modified NFW (mNFW) profile as decribed by Matthews & Prochaska 2017 and Prochaska & Zheng 2019 is unable to reproduce the radial profile of baryons resulting from galactic feedback in halos from simulations. Namely, Ayromlou+2023 highlight the existence of a \"closure radius\" $r_{close}$. $r_{close}$ is the smallest radius within which the ratio of enclosed baryon mass $M_B(<r)$ to enclosed total matter mass, $M_M(<r)$ is the cosmic mean, $\\Omega_B/\\Omega_M$. This implies at least two length scales, the virial radius, $r_{vir}$, and $r_{close}$ that must be encoded in any mathematical model of halo baryon density.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Ayromlou_Fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A second scale radius is missing in mNFW. This leads to spurious behavior when extending mNFW beyond $r_{vir}$, e.g. not enough or too much enclosed baryon mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified-modifed NWF profile (mmNFW) which attempts to resolve this by introducing an exponential correction to mNFW suffers a different flaw because it too doesn't intrinsically encode two lengthscales. Specifically, when normalizing halo baryons such that the cosmic baryon to matter average ratio is reached at a large $r_{close}$ (compared to $r_{vir}$), the enclosed mass ratio actually crosses this threshold much earlier, i.e. below $r_{vir}$, and then severely exceeds this limit between this first crossing and $r_{close}$ (See figure below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Lordrick_mmNFW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a new baryon model framework is required that correctly encodes the behavior of the enclosed mass ratio. The $g\\times M_{DM}$ model is an attempt to derive a baryon density profile that automatically respects the mass ratio constraint. Also, as a side-efect, it is generalizable to numerically model *any* baryon simulation-based radial gas profile."

    "### Functional properties of $g$\n",
    "As one can see, the final form of the baryon profile is agnostic to the specific dark matter profile assumed and to $g(y)$. The only requirement is that one can compute the enclosed mass profile and density profile of the dark matter. Thus, this framework can be used to define baryon profiles for any dark matter profile, not just NFW. The form of this equation should also make sense. The first term is simply a scaled version of the dark matter profile modulated by $g(y)$. This is, in a sense, similar to mnNFW or mmNFW. The second term can be thought of as a \"correction\" to ensure the proper behaviour of the enclosed mass fraction. If $g(y)$ is constant, this term vanishes and one recovers the trivial solution where the baryon profile is simply a scaled version of the dark matter profile. Indeed, as $g(y) \\to 1$ at large radius, $dg/dy$ must tend to 0 faster than $M_{DM}(<y)/y^2$ grows to $\\infty$. So, this term also vanishes and the baryon profile asymptotically approaches a scaled dark matter profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunil notes: One might have started out with a dark matter density profile and modulated it with a radial function instead of starting with enclosed mass profiles. I have an intuition that the integration by parts would yield a functional form that is not as clean and hard to programmatically implement. The intrepid reader might wish to verify this."

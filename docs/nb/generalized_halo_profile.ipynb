    "## Motivation\n",
    "The modified NFW (mNFW) profile as decribed by Matthews & Prochaska 2017 and Prochaska & Zheng 2019 is unable to reproduce the radial profile of baryons resulting from galactic feedback in halos from simulations. Namely, Ayromlou+2023 highlight the existence of a \"closure radius\" $r_{close}$. $r_{close}$ is the smallest radius within which the ratio of enclosed baryon mass $M_B(<r)$ to enclosed total matter mass, $M_M(<r)$ is the cosmic mean, $\\Omega_B/\\Omega_M$. This implies the existence of at least two length scales, the virial radius, $r_{vir}$, and $r_{close}$ that must be encoded in any mathematical model of halo baryon density.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Ayromlou_Fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A second scale radius is missing in mNFW. This leads to spurious behavior when extending mNFW beyond $r_{vir}$, e.g. not enough or too much enclosed baryon mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified-modifed NWF profile (mmNFW) which attempts to resolve this by introducing an exponential correction to mNFW suffers a different flaw because it too doesn't intrinsically encode two lengthscales. Specifically, when normalizing halo baryons such that the cosmic baryon to matter average ratio is reached at a large $r_{close}$ (compared to $r_{vir}$), the enclosed mass ratio actually crosses this threshold much earlier, i.e. below $r_{vir}$, and then severely exceeds this limit between this first crossing and $r_{close}$ (See figure below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Lordrick_mmNFW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a new baryon model framework is required that correctly encodes the behavior of the enclosed mass ratio. The $g\\times NFW$ model is an attempt to derive a baryon density profile that automatically respects the mass ratio constraint. Also, as a side-efect, it is generalizable to numerically model *any* baryon simulation-based radial gas profile."

    "## Derivation of the most general baryon profile\n",
    "One begins with the assumption that the dark matter profile is described by NFW. This is not a correct assumption, especially in the light of baryon back-reaction, but helps to illustrate the mathematics easily. As one sees later, the framework is generalizable to any dark matter profile. This is merely a method to self-consistently define a baryon profile given a dark matter profile.\n",

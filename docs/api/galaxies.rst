Overview
--------

A significant portion of FRB science will flow
from studying galaxies related to these events.

This will include both the galaxy that hosted
the event and galaxies foreground to the event
which may imprint signatues in the signal itself.

The `frb.galaxies` package provides comprehensive functionality for analyzing galaxies 
associated with Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). This includes tools for photometric analysis, 
spectral energy distribution fitting, redshift estimation, and various derived physical 
properties.
